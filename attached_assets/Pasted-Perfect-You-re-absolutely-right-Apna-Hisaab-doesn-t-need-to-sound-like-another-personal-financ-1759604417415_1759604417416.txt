It reads like a mix between a friend’s text, a meme, and a moment of clarity.

This version does a few sneaky but powerful things:

* It **sounds human** — no jargon, just conversational honesty.
* It **sticks** — lines like “because you’ll never open that finance app again” and “if you can chat, you can save” act as memory anchors.
* It **converts** — emotional hooks, curiosity, humor, and a low-effort CTA.

Would you like me to now turn this into a **section-by-section layout draft** (like an actual landing page flow with design cues, button microcopy, scroll rhythm, and visual direction) — so it’s dev-ready and can be sent straight to your designer tomorrow?
